## How to Deploy to Vercel

This project is configured for easy deployment to Vercel.

### Prerequisites

1.  **A Vercel Account**: If you don't have one, sign up for free at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com).
2.  **Vercel CLI**: You need to have the Vercel command-line interface installed. If you don't, run this command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    npm install -g vercel
    ```

### Deployment Steps

1.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    Open your terminal and change into the project's root directory.
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/Park Save
    ```

2.  **Deploy**:
    Run the `vercel` command to start the deployment process.
    ```bash
    vercel
    ```

3.  **Follow the Prompts**:
    The Vercel CLI will guide you through the rest of the process. It will ask you to confirm the project details. Since you have a `vercel.json` file, most settings will be automatically detected. Accept the defaults to deploy.

Once the deployment is complete, Vercel will provide you with a live URL for your project.
